# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This project was to display the several works created by me to showcases my skills. Although these images and links are place-holders, it provides a place for my projects to be presented to potential employers.

## Installation

This project was completed from scratch in VS Code. While using references, I implemented new skills such as gradients and linked images, while using basic tecniques such as anchored links and classic casscading techqniques. 

## Usage

By starting with a basic skeleton, you then add in you html for whatever structure you would prefer. You then create a style.css sheet and get creative! This project is for you, so it gets to be subjective.
