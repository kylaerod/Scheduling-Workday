# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This project is to allow the user to store their workday calendar locally. They should be able to refresh the page and still have their day stored on the calendar. The times should also correspond with the current time, gray being in the past, red being current, and green meaning future. This showcases the power of javascript ith local storage and the use of day.js and its amazing uses.

## Installation

This project was completed using starter code from gitHub by username crispy-octo-meme. It was then improved by adding javascript. The only adjustment to code was an addition of times and the adjustment of spacing.

## Usage

By starting with a basic skeleton, you then add in javascript for the function of the calendar.
